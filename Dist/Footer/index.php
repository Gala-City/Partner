        If you withdraw from the University of Redlands during a semester, a calculation of “earned” versus “unearned” federal aid must be determined. This federal policy assumes you earn your aid based on how much time has elapsed in the term. If you receive federal financial aid, that aid may be reduced as a result of your withdrawal. There are three steps that the University of Redlands must complete to comply with the federal policy:
        Determine the withdrawal date
        Determine the amount of earned federal aid.
        Return unearned federal funds to the appropriate program(s).
